# 2.1.0
* Rather than deleting the entire folder when doing `ember new-baseline`, now only deletes current OS
  * `--delete-all` option added to delete entire  visual acceptance folder
  * This will help when doing Multi-OS https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/multi-os/
    * Although user will have to pull before they run `ember tva` in this scenario (since Linux will push. Than Mac will push) Fun race conditions

# 2.0.1
* Update README file to match with 2.0.0
* Pin ResembleJS to 2.2.0 to avoid breaking change in 2.2.2

* Make the directory `default/` rather than '`<element-width>x<element-height>/`. This does not affect elements where the size is specified.
  * This will help scenarios where targeted element show up as `New` rather than `Changed` simply b/c the size of the target changed.
  *  Also it's easier to navigate instead of having to open every folder to see where the target element is located
